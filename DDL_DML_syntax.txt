How to create a databse on postgresql:

CREATE DATABASE (name_database)

How to restore or load data to the database:

-by using the psql shell:
   -cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin
   -pg_restore -U postgres -d (name_database where you want to restore data) (path of data to restore)

-by using pgadmin:
   -select the database
   -go on tool>restore and select the path of data to restore

DDL: Data definition language

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype column_constraint,
    column2 datatype column_constraint,
    column3 datatype column_constraint,
   ....
);
for example:

create Table Berries(
   berry_id int primary key,
   berry_name varchar(255) not null
   ...
)

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name data_type column_constraint;

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name SET DATA TYPE data_type;

ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN current_column_name TO new_column_name;

Truncate removes all data from a table
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

Drop deletes the tables from the database
DROP TABLE table_name;

SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
WHERE column_name OPERATOR
   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   WHERE condition);

How does an Implicit version of CROSS JOIN (also known as Cartesian Join) statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1, table2;

How does an Implicit version of INNER JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1, table2
WHERE table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

PostgreSQL Update syntax to update data records in the table:

Update table_name
set column1=value1,
column2=value2,
...
(where condition)

Postgresql Delete syntax to delete data records in the table:
delete from table_name
(where condition)

Difference between Delete and Truncate:
1:Delete command is used to delete specified rows while truncate commande 
is used to delete all the rows from a table

2:There may be a WHERE clause in delete statement in order to filter the records 
while there may not be WHERE clause in TRUNCATE statement

3:The delete statement removes rows one at the time and records an entry in the transaction log 
for each deleted row while TRUNCATE removes data by deallocating the data pages used
to store the table data and records only the deallocations in the transaction log

4: Identity of the column retains the Identity after using delete statement
while on the truncate statement Identity is reset to its seed value if the table contains 
an identity column
Postgresql insert syntax to insert data records in the table:

Insert into table_name (column1, column2,...)
values 
(value1,value2,...),#for the first record to add
(value1,value2,...),#for the second record to add and so on

DCL Statements: Data Control language statements:

Grant statement: Grant update on order_backlog to jones with grant option
                 Grant select on table q.staff to public
               
Revoke statement: used to cancel previously granted or denied permissions 
                  Revoke all on employees from anderson

         
            ACID TRANSACTIONS

 A transaction is: 
   -Indivisible unit of work
   -Consists of one or more sql statements
   -Either all happens or none 

ACID stands for :
   -Atomic: All changes must be performed successfully or not at all
            This provides reliability because if there is a failure in 
            the middle of the transaction, none of the changes will be commited

   -Consistent: Data must be in a consistent state before and after the transaction
                Ensures the transaction maintains data integrity constraints, leaving
                data consistent

   -Isolated: No other process can change the data while the transaction is running
              
   -Durable: The changes made by the transaction must persist   
             Ensures that the information saved in the database are immutable until
             another update or deletion transaction affects them 

Syntax: Begin
            Start the acid transaction
        Commit
            All statements complete Successfully
            Save the new database state
       Rollback(to undo all the transaction if something went wrong)
            One or more statements failed
            Undo changes

Sql statements can be called from java, c, r, python


                                             Temporary table:

It's a table that exists temporarily on the database server

It stores a subset of data from a normal table for a certain period of time

Particularly useful when you have a large number of records in a table and you repeatedly need 
to interact with a small subset of thoses records

In such cases, instead of filtering data again and again to fetch the subset, you can filter once and store it in a temporary table

it gets stored inside of "tempdb" which is a system database

Must start with '#'

Syntax: select * into #tempdb from DimAccount
